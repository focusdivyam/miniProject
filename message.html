                emphasis is laid on total personality development along with the quality education and technical
                training of the students. Indian Institute of Technology Patna is fully networked with industry, as well
                as

                industries in India and abroad. Indian Institute of Technology Patna is the alma mater of highly
                distinguished
                world class engineers and technologists.<br><br>
                Indian Institute of Technology Patna has kept the quality of education and research as its main focus of
                academic and professional activities and this has earned a high reputation in the country and abroad as
                is evident from IITP figuring several times among the top ten engineering institutions in the country
                along with the IITs. Alumni, Staff, students and supporters take pride in having contributed to the
                Indian Institute of Technology Patna reputation as India's flagship, research-led university, known for

                Our challenge for the future is to build on this strong base to establish ourselves firmly among the
                world's leading universities. I hope our outstanding students will support us in this endeavour and in
                turn emerge themselves, as pioneers of an exemplary society.
